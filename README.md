# Gromgit Tools

A collection of miscellaneous tools I find useful, that aren't found in Homebrew core.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install gromgit/tools/<formula>`

Or `brew tap gromgit/tools` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "gromgit/tools"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
